GeoLocation Matcher

Functionality

The GeoLocation Matcher is a Python tool that matches each point in one array of geolocations to the closest point in another array using the Haversine formula. It calculates the spherical distance between latitude/longitude pairs to determine the closest match.

How It Works
	1.	Users input two arrays of geolocations interactively (latitude, longitude pairs).
	2.	For each point in the first array, the program finds the closest point in the second array.
	3.	Outputs the closest match and the distance in kilometers.
